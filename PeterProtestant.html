	<h1> St Peter's Church of Ireland </h1>

	St Peters Church of Ireland stands on the site of the earliest church in Drogheda, established in the 12th century. 
	It was sacked in 1649 by Cromwells troops who set fire to it, killing many citizens who had taken refuge in its wooden steeple. 
	It was partly rebuilt in 1666 and rebuilt in 1749. The beautiful porch & spire were added in 1793. Itis a wonderful example of a Georgian church. 
	With its cut-stone facade and rich rococo plasterwork It has been described as "probably the finest provincial Georgian church in Ireland". 
	The present interior of the Church is largely the result of a major reordering in the late 19th century which not only provides great acoustics for the voice 
	but also for orchestras which use the church for classical concerts. The sanctuary area was reordered in 1907 and the present pulpit and prayer desk installed circa 1909. 
	The organ, for which the Corporation of Drogheda gave £300 in 1771, was built for the Church by John Snetzler in London and has recently been restored. 
	For several centuries the Archbishops of Armagh, whose diocese includes Drogheda, lived in Drogheda and St. Peters served as their pro-Cathedral.

	Within the churchyard of St. Peter's can be found many interesting and varied funerary monuments. Of these, perhaps the most interesting and visited is a "cadaver stone" 
	taken from the tomb of Sir Edmond Goldyng and his wife Elizabeth Fleming. It is built into the churchyard wall, east of the present building and shows two cadavers 
	enclosed in shrouds which have been partially opened to show the remains of the occupants of the tomb. The tomb dates from the first quarter of the 16th century.

	A fine tombstone also stands over the grave of John Duggan, a Drogheda man who as a private in the 17th Lancers fought in the Crimean campaign. 
	He was a survivor of the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava and the battles of Alma and Sevastopol. Duggan was, on his discharge from the Army, 
	employed as Sexton in St. Peter's where he served from c1873 until his death in 1881.
