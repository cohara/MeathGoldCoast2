	<h1> The Millmount Fort and Martello Tower </h1>
	
	</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>
	Drogheda's most striking feature, situated high above the town, the origins of the Millmount Fort 
	are shrouded in legend. Some believe that the mound may have been the burial place of Amergin, 
	a Celtic poet, but the Fort may equally have been a large passage grave like Newgrange. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Millmount was fortified as a motte by the Normans in the twelfth century and a castle was later built on the summit. 
	Cromwell met with his strongest opposition here during the siege of 1649, and the town's Governor, Arthur Aston, 
	was killed here during the fighting. Cromwell's subsequent massacre of the garrison and townsfolk is still recalled today.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The old fortifications were demolished in 1808 to be replaced with the present Martello-type tower. 
	In the course of the Civil War of 1922, the fort was shelled from the town by Free State forces and seriously damaged. 
	It has now been restored and in recent years 2 magnificent cannon guns have been installed overlooking the town. 
	They are fired on festive occasions. As well as the museum a craft gallery is now housed here.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h1>  The Millmount Museum </h1>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>
	Founded in 1974 by the Old Drogheda Society, Millmount museum hosts a range of exhibits including Guild and Trade banners 
	stretching back two centuries; an industrial exhibition; a geological collection; a recreated 19th century kitchen; 
	an archeological display, covering much of the Continental influence on Drogheda over past centuries; 
	a demonstration of Drogheda's early telephone system; a rowing club exhibition; and the Military Room, 
	which boasts a large collection of guns including the 'Fenian rifles' found hidden in the attic of a Franciscan Friary in Drogheda.
