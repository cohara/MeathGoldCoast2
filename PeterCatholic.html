                <h1> St Peter's Roman Catholic Church </h1> 


                <br>

                <p>
                    Situated in West Street in the centre of the town, St Peter's is a splendid edifice in the modern Gothic style. 
                    Being built at the top of a double flight of wide steps an excellent view can be obtained of the imposing façade and spire. 
                    The site previously housed a church built in 1791 and parts of that structure were incorporated into the present building, 
                    constructed using local limestone in 1884. The church houses fine sculptures, a spectacular marble High Altar and more than 40 stained glass windows. 
                    The holy water font in the porch is a finely carved medieval baptismal font. However, the church is most famous for its' shrine to 
                    St. Oliver Plunkett whose preserved head is the centerpiece of the shrine.

                <p>
                    St. Oliver Plunkett, was born at Loughcrew near Oldcastle, Co Meath and trained for the priesthood abroad before being ordained in 1654 
                    and becoming Archbishop of Armagh in 1669. He spent a lot of time in Drogheda and is credited with bringing the Jesuits to town 
                    and opening a number of schools. With the introduction of the Penal Laws, Catholics were not allowed practice their religion openly 
                    but Plunkett managed to defy them for a period before going into hiding, traveling only in disguise. 
                    He was arrested in Dublin in 1679 on a trumoped up charge of treason. False witnesses testified against him but even a Protestant jury 
                    in Ireland would not convict him. He was transferred to Newgate prison in London, tried for treason, convicted and sentenced to death. 
                    On 11th July 1681 he was taken to Tyburn (now Marble Arch) and hanged, drawn and quartered. His head was rescued from his funeral pyre 
                    and today is the centerpiece of the shrine here in St Peters. Oliver Plunkett was beatified in 1920 and canonised in 1975. 
                    In 1979 Pope John Paul II visited Drogheda and prayed before his relic.
